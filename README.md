# hangman2

Dependencies:
random-word, tkinter, *pyyaml


------
This script plays hangman. The man who dies is in ASCII, make sure that the path to the "word_selection.txt" is correct on line 66. Sometimes the random-word package has some issues and glitches, which is why the word_selection file was put in place. The code needs some cleaning up, but this works.


\* When tested on OSX, the pyyaml package had to be installed in order to work.

------
Color schemes are open to changes, im bad at making things look good.
------
Code needs some cleaning up with all of the global variables still
